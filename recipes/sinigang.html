        <h3>Sour Pork and Vegetable Stew - A Filipino Classic</h3>
        <p>It's simple to cook some sinigang for any occasion! Gather the core ingredients: pork belly, roma tomatoes, onions, kangkong leaves, string beans and a packet of Tamarind Soup Mix. Prepare the ingredients: cube the pork belly; quarter the tomatoes; slice and onions; pluck the leaf bunches from the base of the stem on the kangkong leaves; and cut the string beans to a shorter length.</p>

        <p>In a large pot, heat up some cooking oil. Sauté the onions and cook the pork belly cubes until lightly browned. Pour in some water and bring to a boil. Add in the tomatoes then simmer until the protein is tender. Stir in packet mix and string beans. After a few minutes, turn off the heat, put in the kangkong leaves and cover. Once the leaves have cooked and softened, serve with a bowl of rice. Enjoy!</p>
