        <h3>Rich Pork Blood Stew - Creamy and Filling</h3>
        <p>As terrifying it is to consume blood willingly, this dish offers it in a palatable form. The vinegar cuts through the richness of the blood while the chili peppers give it depth of flavor. Offals are used in conjunction with pork belly cubes as filling but the process of stewing removes the iron taste and yields a tender, delicious bite for first time tasters.</p>

        <p>Most often served with rice for dinner or as a lunch time snack with some puto (steamed rice cakes). Many Filipino restaurants have their own recipe with making dinuguan-others enjoy the tangy, iron taste while some prefer to completely cook down the blood and substitute the offals with meats. However you want to eat it, it is sure to get you to reconsider other blood-based food.</p>
