        <h3>Savory Vegetable Stew - An Ilocano Dish</h3>
        <p>Originating from the Ilocos region of the Philippines, this dish makes use of the abundance of vegetables available in the Philippines. Originally a dish using only vegetables, its spread towards the mainland has made rise to several adaptations and versions. Now, most versions include pork belly and calabasa, or winter squash.</p>

        <p>The protein can be substituted with fish or grilled meats to introduce different textures and flavor profiles. The shrimp paste can be cooked down further to lessen its fishy taste. This dish can be served as a main entree with rice or a side dish for other, hearty meals. If you have any vegetables lying around, consider cooking up some pinakbet!</p>
